This is the collection of custom python code that runs on the Raspberry Pi
part of the system. (See system diagram in "docs".)

At this point, it is completely a works in progress.  It runs as is without errors.

Functionality (at least):
+ reads the locally connected motion detector
+ controls a locally connected solid state relay for lights
+ publishes locally connected sensors to the mosquitto data broker using mqtt
+ can respond to a change in the light mqtt topic (from NodeRed for example)
+ maintains a local copy of all of the data on the broker (e.g. remote module temp, humidity)
+ first simple motion->light alarm response and architecture to support more

# v0.5:
# + added conf["LOCATION"] to be more specific with messages
# + added sending email messages on motion event ... it works !
# + added the holdoff timer for the motion event ... cool !
# + added periodic notification of t/h/g values
# + corrected bug where subscribed parameters were all being set as raw strings
# + moved all of the hardware i/o to the MonitoringParameters Env() class
# + made json decoding option in the on_message method
# + fixed a bug using bool() with strings in on_message
# + finish up the override logic for light and auto
#


Now that all of the data is flowing, I'll focus on getting some automatic alarming funcitons
working.
