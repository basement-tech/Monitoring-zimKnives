This is the collection of custom python code that runs on the Raspberry Pi
part of the system. (See system diagram in "docs".)

At this point, it is completely a works in progress.  It runs as is without errors.

Functionality (at least):
+ reads the locally connected motion detector
+ controls a locally connected solid state relay for lights
+ publishes locally connected sensors to the mosquitto data broker using mqtt
+ can respond to a change in the light mqtt topic (from NodeRed for example)
+ maintains a local copy of all of the data on the broker (e.g. remote module temp, humidity)
+ first simple motion->light alarm response and architecture to support more

Now that all of the data is flowing, I'll focus on getting some automatic alarming funcitons
working.
